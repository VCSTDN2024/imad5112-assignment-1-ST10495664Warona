# Mealplanner app
# An app created to help on the differents types of meal suggestions

This project was created to guide people on the types of meals they can have instead of spending the entire day trying to decide what type of breakfast or lunch one whats to have. It is very helpful because all you have to do is enter the time of day and then a meal will be suggested.This app is supposed to make life easier. When you open the app you will see an option where you can enter the time of day e.g., morning and then a meal will be suggested. There is even suggestions for when one wants a snack.
